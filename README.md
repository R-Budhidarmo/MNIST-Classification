# MNIST-Classification

</br> This project explores supervised machine learning using Random Forest algorithm to build a classification model based on the MNIST dataset.
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset of images (pixel values) of handwritten digits, first [published by LeCun et al.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). In this particular instance, the data set has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) & it has been divided into a training set ('mnist-train.csv) & a test set ('mnist-test.csv') (included in this repo).

**What does it do?**
</br>The repo essentially consists of a Jupyter notebook and the aforementioned csv raw data files.
The code within the Jupyter notebook leverages well-known Python libraries, such as:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

</br>These modules usually come standard, for example, when Python3 is downloaded through [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/).
If not, please don't forget to install them (e.g. pip install).

**Who is this for?**
</br>Like myself, anyone who is new at data science & ML. I'm more than happy to collaborate or if you simply want to use the code as an example or for other learning purposes.

**Last Note**
</br>This was a project that was completed as part of a 16-week Data Science bootcamp offered by [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
I'm keen to collaborate & exchange ideas about data science & ML. However, for queries about the bootcamp content & curriculum, please contact HyperionDev directly.
</br>I hope you'll find the code useful.
### Thanks a lot!
